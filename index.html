            ABOUT ME
            A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many
            pages
            (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover.[1] The technical
            term
            for this physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices). In the history of hand-held physical supports for
            extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet in
            a
            codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page.
